# 🏠 House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## 🌟 Problem Statement

When buying a house, factors like the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence may come to mind, but real estate is far more complex. This project explores **79 explanatory variables** that capture nearly every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The objective is to predict the **final price** of a house using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Gain insights into the dataset:
- Visualizations to identify patterns and outliers.
- Descriptive statistics for initial understanding.

### 2. Handling Missing Values
- **Continuous Variables**: Techniques like mean/median imputation.
- **Categorical Variables**: Filling with modes or creating new categories.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Creating interaction features.
- Handling skewed distributions.

### 4. Model Development
- Training multiple regression models.
- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluating the models using metrics like RMSE.

### 5. Prediction
- Generating predictions for unseen data.
